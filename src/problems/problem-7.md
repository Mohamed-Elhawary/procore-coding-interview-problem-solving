# Problem #7: Task Dependencies (Topological Sort)

## Problem

Return a valid execution order for tasks given their dependencies.

## Explanation

- Each task has a list of `dependsOn` task ids.
- Return an array with a valid order for executing all tasks (topological sort).

## Input

An array of tasks, for example:

```js
const tasks = [
  { id: "A", dependsOn: ["B", "C"] },
  { id: "B", dependsOn: ["C"] },
  { id: "C", dependsOn: [] },
];
```

## Output

An array of task ids in a valid execution order.
