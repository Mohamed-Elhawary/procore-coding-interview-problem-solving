        <h2>Problem #1: Project Overlap Checker</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b>
          Given a list of project objects, each with a startDate and endDate, write a function to check if any projects overlap in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Explanation:</b>
          Two projects are considered to overlap if:
          <ul>
              <li>The start date of one project is before the end date of another project.</li>
              <li>The end date of the first project is after the start date of the other project.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Input:</b>
          An array of project objects, for example:
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const projects = [
  { name: "A", startDate: "2024-05-01", endDate: "2024-05-10" },
  { name: "B", startDate: "2024-05-09", endDate: "2024-05-20" },
];</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Output:</b>
          The function should return <code>true</code> if any projects overlap, and <code>false</code> otherwise.
        </p>

      <!-- Problem 2 -->
      <section id="problem_2" class="problem">
        <h2>Problem #2: Resource Allocation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b>
          Assign each task to a worker who has the required skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Explanation:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Each task has a requiredSkill.</li>
            <li>Each worker has a skills array (the set of skills they possess).</li>
            <li>Your goal is to map each task to a worker who has the skill required for that task.</li>
            <li>If no worker is available for a task, indicate that the task is unassigned.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Input:</b>
          An array of tasks and workers, for example:
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const tasks = [
  { id: 1, name: "Welding", requiredSkill: "welding" },
  { id: 2, name: "Painting", requiredSkill: "painting" },
];
const workers = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", skills: ["welding", "carpentry"] },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", skills: ["painting"] },
];</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Output:</b>
          A mapping of each task to a worker who has the required skill.
          If multiple workers have the required skill, you can assign any of them.
          If no worker is available for a task, indicate that the task is unassigned (e.g., by assigning null).

      <!-- Problem 3 -->
      <section id="problem_3" class="problem">
        <h2>Problem #3: Materials Stock Alert</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b>
          Return all materials whose quantity is below a given threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Explanation:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Loop through the inventory.</li>
            <li>If a material's quantity is less than the threshold, include its name in the result.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Input:</b>
          An array of inventory items and a threshold, for example:
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const inventory = [
  { name: "Cement", quantity: 40 },
  { name: "Bricks", quantity: 200 },
];
const threshold = 100;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Output:</b>
          An array of material names whose quantity is below the threshold.

      <section id="problem_4" class="problem">
        <h2>Problem #4: Gantt Chart Data Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b>
          Convert project phases into a Gantt chart-friendly format, including each phase's duration in days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Explanation:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>For each phase, calculate the number of days between startDate and endDate (inclusive).</li>
            <li>Add a duration property to each phase object.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Input:</b>
          An array of project phases, for example:
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const phases = [
  { name: "Excavation", startDate: "2024-05-01", endDate: "2024-05-03" },
  { name: "Construction", startDate: "2024-06-04", endDate: "2024-09-02" },
];</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Output:</b>
          An array of phase objects, each with a <code>duration</code> property and (in days).
