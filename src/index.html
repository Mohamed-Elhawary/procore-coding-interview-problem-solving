        <h2>Problem #1: Project Overlap Checker</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b>
          Given a list of project objects, each with a startDate and endDate,
          write a function to check if any projects overlap in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Explanation:</b>
          Two projects are considered to overlap if:

          <ul>
            <li>         
               The start date of one project is <b>before</b> the end date of another project.
            </li>
            <li>
              The end date of the first project is <b>after</b> the start date of the other project.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Input:</b>
          An array of project objects, for example:
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const projects = [
  { name: "A", startDate: "2024-05-01", endDate: "2024-05-10" },
  { name: "B", startDate: "2024-05-09", endDate: "2024-05-20" },
];
</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Output:</b>
The function should return true if any projects overlap, and false otherwise.
        </p>
